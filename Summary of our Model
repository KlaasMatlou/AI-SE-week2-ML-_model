# SDG problem addressed.

Primary SDG Addressed: SDG 2 - Zero Hunger

Target 2.4: "By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems,
that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality."

How the model contributes:
Increases Productivity and Production: By providing more accurate yield forecasts, farmers can make better decisions about planting, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, leading to potentially higher yields.
Strengthens Capacity for Adaptation to Climate Change and Extreme Weather:
The model uses real-time weather data and incorporates metrics like GDD. This helps in understanding how current weather conditions might impact yield, 
allowing for more informed and adaptive responses to changing climate patterns and extreme events.
Supports Resilient Agricultural Practices:
Better predictions enable more proactive planning and resource management, making farming systems more resilient to environmental shocks.
Secondary SDG Connections:

SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth

Target 8.4: "Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavor to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, 
in accordance with the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead."

Target 8.6: "By 2020, reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training." (While less direct, supporting the agricultural sector can create economic opportunities).

How the model contributes:

Increases Resource Efficiency: More accurate yield predictions help farmers optimize the use of inputs like water, fertilizers, and pesticides, leading to greater resource efficiency and potentially reducing environmental impact.
Boosts Economic Stability for Farmers: Reducing uncertainty in yield forecasts helps farmers plan financially, secure loans, and make better decisions about selling their produce, contributing to their economic stability.
SDG 13 - Climate Action

Target 13.1: "Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries."

Target 13.3: "Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning."

How the model contributes:

Strengthens Resilience and Adaptive Capacity: As mentioned under SDG 2, the model's use of real-time weather data and its ability to forecast yield under varying conditions directly supports adaptation to climate change impacts.
Supports Impact Reduction and Early Warning: By providing forecasts, the model can serve as an early warning system for potential low yields due to adverse conditions, allowing for interventions or preparation.

### APROACH USED

Our machine learning approach is based on supervised learning using an XGBoost Regressor model. 
We chose XGBoost for its strong performance on structured data and its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features.
We trained the model on historical data, including weather, crop type, and engineered features like Growing Degree Days and Soil Moisture. 
We optimized the model using Grid Search with cross-validation to ensure it performs well on new, unseen data.

## Results and Ethical consideration

Summary of Model Results and Ethical Considerations

Model Performance Summary:

The developed XGBoost Regressor model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities for crop yield. 
Evaluation metrics show a Training R² of 1.00 (MAE ~1470 kg/ha, RMSE ~2318 kg/ha), indicating a perfect fit to the training data. On the unseen testing data, the model achieved an R² of 0.98 (MAE ~4807 kg/ha, RMSE ~10762 kg/ha).
While the significant difference between training and testing metrics suggests some overfitting to the training data, the model still explains a very high percentage (98%) of the variance in test set yield, 
demonstrating excellent generalization performance on unseen data.

Ethical Considerations:

Deployment of crop yield prediction models necessitates careful consideration of ethical implications. Key factors include:

Data Bias: Ensuring the representativeness and diversity of training data to prevent biased predictions that could disadvantage certain farmers or regions.
Access and Equity: Promoting equitable access to this technology to ensure its benefits are available to all stakeholders, including smallholder farmers.
Transparency: Exploring methods to provide users with insights into why a prediction was made to build trust and facilitate informed decision-making.
Data Privacy: Implementing robust measures for the secure handling and storage of sensitive agricultural and farmer data.
Addressing these ethical considerations is vital for the responsible and beneficial application of the model in the agricultural sector.
